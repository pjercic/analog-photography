## 🔭 Overview
This repository hosts a complete, open-source curriculum for Analog Photography. It bridges the gap between **STEM** (Optics, Chemistry, Geometry) and **Humanities** (History, Philosophy, Psychology).

The course is designed as a **Spiral Curriculum**: students encounter the same core pillars (Light, Chemistry, Perception) at every level, but with increasing complexity—from building cardboard pinholes in primary school to synthesizing silver-gelatin emulsions at the university level.

## 📚 Curriculum Structure

### [Level 1: Observation & Wonder (Primary)](/01_primary)
*Focus: Direct observation, permanent shadows, and intuitive physics.*
* **Physics:** The Camera Obscura & Light Paths.
* **Chemistry:** Sun Prints (Cyanotypes) & UV sensitivity.
* **Art:** Pareidolia & Finding the Alphabet in shadows.

### [Level 2: Mechanics & Reaction (Secondary)](/02_secondary)
*Focus: Refraction, standard development, and mechanical control.*
* **Physics:** Lenses, Focal Length, and the Sliding Box Camera.
* **Chemistry:** The Latent Image & Caffenol (Coffee) Development.
* **History:** Pictorialism vs. Modernism.

### [Level 3: Control & Calculation (High School)](/03_high_school)
*Focus: Stoichiometry, sensitometry, and advanced composition.*
* **Physics:** The Reciprocity Law ($E=It$) & Depth of Field calculations.
* **Chemistry:** Redox reactions, fixing agents, and scratch-mixing developers.
* **Psychology:** Gestalt Principles & The Decisive Moment.

### [Level 4: Engineering & Philosophy (University)](/04_university)
*Focus: Material science, quantum effects, and critical theory.*
* **Physics:** Wave-Particle Duality, H&D Curves, and Densitometry.
* **Chemistry:** Colloid chemistry & Silver Nitrate Emulsion synthesis.
* **Philosophy:** Sontag, Barthes, and the ethics of the documentation.

## 🛠 Lab Manuals & Rigs
We believe in building tools to understand them.
* [**Build: The Room Obscura**](/lab_manuals/rig_room_obscura.md) (Level 1)
* [**Build: The Sliding Box Camera**](/lab_manuals/rig_sliding_box.md) (Level 2)
* [**Build: Arduino Densitometer**](/lab_manuals/rig_densitometer.md) (Level 4)

## ⚠️ Safety & MSDS
Safety is part of the science. All chemical experiments include strict safety data sheets.
