# ⚗️ The Latent Image: The Invisible Photograph

## 1. The Silver Halide Crystal
Film is not just plastic; it is a chemical delivery system. The "emulsion" (the dull side of the film) is gelatin holding millions of microscopic crystals suspended in it.

These crystals are **Silver Halides** ($AgX$).
* **Ag** = Silver (Positive Ion)
* **X** = Halogen (usually Bromine or Iodine, Negative Ion)

The structure is a cubic lattice. It is electrically neutral in the dark.

## 2. The Photon Strike (The Gurney-Mott Theory)
When you click the shutter, light (photons) hits the film. This happens in nanoseconds.

1.  **Excitation:** A photon hits a Halide ion ($Br^-$) and knocks an electron loose.
    $$Br^- + h\nu \rightarrow Br + e^-$$
2.  **The Trap:** The free electron ($e^-$) roams the crystal until it gets stuck in a "sensitivity speck" (an impurity intentionally added by engineers, usually Sulfur or Gold).
3.  **Attraction:** The negatively charged speck now acts like a magnet. It attracts positive Silver ions ($Ag^+$) that are floating nearby.
4.  **Formation:** The Silver ion meets the electron and becomes metallic silver.
    $$Ag^+ + e^- \rightarrow Ag_{(metal)}$$

## 3. The Result
We now have a few atoms of metallic silver.
* **Is it visible?** No. It is too small to see, even with a microscope.
* **What is it called?** The **Latent Image**.

To see the image, we must amplify this reaction billions of times using a chemical **Developer**.

## 🧠 Thought Experiment
If you leave the film in the camera for 100 years, the Latent Image will fade. The electrons eventually escape the trap, and the silver creates a "fog." This is why expired film looks gray and low-contrast.
