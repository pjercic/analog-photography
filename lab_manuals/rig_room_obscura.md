# 🛠 Build Guide: The Room Obscura (Camera Obscura)

## 📋 Overview
**Level:** 1 (Primary School)
**Time:** 45-60 Minutes
**Concept:** Rectilinear Propagation of Light (Light travels in straight lines)

In this lab, we will turn an entire classroom into a camera. We will darken the room completely and allow light to enter through a single, tiny hole. This will project the outside world—clouds, cars, people—onto the walls and ceiling, upside down and in full color.

## 🧰 Materials Needed
* **Black Trash Bags (Heavy Duty):** Enough to cover every window completely.
* **Duct Tape / Gaffer Tape:** Black or dark blue is best to stop light leaks.
* **Cardboard:** One small piece (approx. 20cm x 20cm).
* **Aluminum Foil:** One small square (10cm x 10cm).
* **Needle or Push Pin:** To make the aperture.
* **Scissors.**

## ⚠️ Safety
* **Darkness:** The room will be pitch black. Clear the floor of trip hazards (backpacks, cords) *before* darkening the windows.
* **Ventilation:** Do not block air vents or AC units with plastic bags.

## 🏗 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: The Blackout
1.  Use the trash bags and tape to cover **100%** of the windows.
2.  Overlap the bags significantly. Light is like water; it will find any leak.
3.  Turn off the lights. Wait 2 minutes for your eyes to adjust. If you see *any* white light coming from the edges, tape it up.

### Step 2: The Lens Mount
1.  Choose the window with the best view (playground, street, trees).
2.  Cut a hole in the center of the plastic bag on that window. The hole should be about the size of a fist (10cm).
3.  Tape the piece of **Cardboard** over this hole.
4.  Cut a smaller square hole (5cm x 5cm) in the center of the cardboard.



### Step 3: The Aperture (The Pinhole)
1.  Take your square of **Aluminum Foil**.
2.  Use the **Needle** to poke a single, clean hole in the center.
    * *Tip:* Twirl the needle gently to make the edges smooth.
3.  Tape the foil over the square hole in the cardboard.

### Step 4: The Reveal
1.  Close the door. Turn off all artificial lights.
2.  Look at the wall *opposite* the window.
3.  **Wait.** It takes about 5 minutes for human eyes to fully adapt to the dark (scotopic vision).
4.  You should see a faint, upside-down image of the outside world on the wall.

## 🔭 The Science: Why is it Upside Down?

Light travels in straight lines.

1.  Light from the **Top** of a tree travels down, through the hole, and hits the **Bottom** of the wall.
2.  Light from the **Bottom** of the tree travels up, through the hole, and hits the **Top** of the wall.

Because the hole (aperture) is so small, the rays verify each other's path, creating a focused image without a glass lens.



## 📝 Discussion Questions
1.  Why is the image dim? (Hint: Think about how much light we blocked vs. how much we let in).
2.  What happens if we make the hole bigger with a pencil? (Try it! The image will get brighter, but blurrier).
3.  Does the image move? (Watch cars or clouds).
